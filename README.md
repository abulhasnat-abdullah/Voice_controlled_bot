# Voice Assisted TurtleBot3

## 📌 Overview
Voice Assist TurtleBot3 is a ROS2-based project that enables controlling a TurtleBot3 in Gazebo simulation using voice commands. The robot responds to spoken commands for movement and energy management, making it a unique interactive experience.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎙️ **Voice-Controlled Navigation**: Move the robot using voice commands like "forward", "left", "right".
- 🔋 **Energy Management System**: The robot consumes energy while moving and can replenish energy using specific voice triggers like "heal" or "kaboom".
- 📡 **Real-time ROS2 Communication**: Uses `rclpy` to process commands and send movement instructions to `/cmd_vel`.
- 🐳 **Dockerized Deployment**: The entire project can be built and run inside a Docker container.
